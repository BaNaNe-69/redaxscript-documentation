Parse issue
-----------

> Instead of seeing what I expected, a white screen of death appears.

Verify your webserver provides PHP 5.4.0 or higher. You can enable another version inside your ```.htaccess``` file:

```
addhandler php54-cgi .php
```

XAMPP ships the PEAR Config that causes a ```Cannot redeclare class Config``` fatal error. Please uncomment the ```include_path``` inside the ```php.ini``` file located in the XAMPP directory:

```
include_path = ".:/php/includes"
```

Enable error reporting inside your ```index.php``` file and submit an issue on GitHub. Make sure to post the error reporting and url of your Redaxscript installation:

```
error_reporting(E_ERROR | E_PARSE);
```


Rewrite issue
-------------

> All pages except my homepage return an internal server error.

Define a rewrite base inside your ```.htaccess``` file:

```
rewritebase /{your-path}
```

Manually load ```mod_rewrite``` inside your ```.htaccess``` file:

```
loadmodule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
```

Define the allow override directive inside your ```.htaccess``` file:

```
allowoverride fileinfo
```

Define the follow symlinks option inside your ```.htaccess``` file:

```
options +followsymlinks
```

Disable the ```rewrite_module``` and Redaxscript uses the query mode.

```
rewriteengine off
```


Session issue
-------------

> My session can't be started or expires frequently.

Define a session path inside your ```.htaccess``` file:

```
session.save_path /{your-path}
```


Token issue
-----------

> My token is invalid.

Your ```session_id()```, ```REMOTE_ADDR```, ```HTTP_USER_AGENT``` or ```HTTP_HOST``` changed while processing the request.


Password issue
--------------

> My password is invalid after the last update.

Redaxscript is using a salted ```SHA1``` hash to store your password inside the database. Use ```domain.com/reminder``` to retrieve a email with the password reset link.


Charset issue
-------------

> Special characters are not displayed correctly.

Define a default charset inside your ```.htaccess``` file:

```
adddefaultcharset utf-8
```
