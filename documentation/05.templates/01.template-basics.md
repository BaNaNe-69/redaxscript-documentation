Templates are located inside the `templates` directory. You can set a global template under `admin/edit/settings` and customize a template for each content.


Getting started
---------------

We highly recommend the `skeleton` template to start on a solid foundation. You can utilize the `preview` module to observe your components while developing.


Hidden feature
--------------

Override the current settings by temporary switching between installed templates:

```
domain.com/article.{template-name}
```

```
domain.com/?p=article&t={template-name}
```
