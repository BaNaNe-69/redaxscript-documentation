Redaxscript is under heavy development and therefore on feature freeze!

Our goal is to refactor the deprecated codebase to an object oriented and modern approach. We love extreme programming and clean code.


Continuous integration
----------------------

A bunch of frontend and backend tools run on [Travis CI](https://travis.redaxscript.com) once a commit has been pushed.


Continuous inspection
---------------------

[Scrutenizer](https://scrutenizer.redaxscript.com) and [Coveralls](https://coveralls.redaxscript.com) are our weapons of choice to keep track on the quality of our codebase.


Continuous deployment
---------------------

We automatically deploy our [Demo](https://demo.redaxscript.com) from the master branch on a daily base.
